# Potluck

This is an ongoing full-stack web application made with Angular on the frontend and .NET / SQL on the backend.

Feel free to have a look around!

## Features

The app isn't currently filled out very much. However, there is a wishlist of features I will slowly be adding over time.

- Users can create their own recipe, write a little blurb about it, add the ingredients, and add the steps necessary.
- Users can tag their recipe (American BBQ, fried, Korean, vegan, etc)
- Users can rate and save recipes they find, and add to a list
- Users can create shopping lists by inputting ingredients manually or by importing from a recipe

## Technologies
- Angular 13
- .NET 6 Minimal API
- SQL Server / Entity Framework Core
- OAuth2 OIDC for authentication 

## Dev Notes

### July 2023

I have started the Angular portion of the project. I want to fill out the infrastructure later on. Not much to show in the way of features. I want to fill out a few of the core modules and build out a super simple home page. No UI / UX work has been done at this time. I've added in Bootstrap just so it looks decent and clean. I'm also going with a mobile-first approach.
